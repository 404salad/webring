## üîÆ What is a Webring?

A webring is a collection of websites linked together in a loop. Each website contains links to the previous and next websites in the ring. If you navigate far enough, eventually you end up back where you started!

Webrings were popular in the early days of the internet as a way for website owners to promote each other's content and encourage community engagement. 

This is a tool for anyone who has some kind of personal website or blog and wishes to connect with others. You can use it to grow your own online community from scratch!
